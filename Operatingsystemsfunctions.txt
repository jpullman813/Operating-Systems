A vital operating system function is to manage programs. For example, in Windows, the only limit to how many programs that a user can have open is the power capability of the device they are running. The operating system can also manage programs by installing and uninstalling programs with little effort made by the user. 
Monitoring performance is a third task that can be managed by the OS. For example, in Windows, by pressing ctrl-alt-delete, or right clicking on the task bar, a user can pull up a task manager. In that task manager, a user can see which programs and processes are using x amount of perfomrance capabilities such as memory. 
Coordinating tasks can also be managed by an OS. For example, the operating system can tell what time it is using the computer's internal clock. At a time specified by the user, the operating system can then pass this information on to a virus protection program by opening it, and can then run a sechduled virus check.
